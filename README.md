# Solutions to Okasaki's 'Purely Functional Data Structures' in Elixir

## Goals

The goal of this project is to attempt to solve all of the coding exercises to Chris Okasaki's _Purely Functional Data Structures_.
The source code in the book itself is written in Standard ML with an appendix that has Haskell solutions. Just doing a brief
search for other implementations brings up a few attempts to solve the exercises in the book in F Sharp, Scala, and a few
smaller examples in Elm.

Attempting to solve the coding exercises from the book in Elixir should be an enlightening experience since it differs semantically
and syntactically quite a bit from the ML-family languages that most of solutions have been written in thus far.
